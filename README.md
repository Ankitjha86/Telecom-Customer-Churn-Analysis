📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer data to understand the reasons behind customer churn. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using Python to handle missing values, data type inconsistencies, and categorical features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations were performed to identify churn patterns based on factors such as tenure, monthly charges, and customer type. The insights from this project can help telecom companies improve customer retention strategies and reduce churn.
